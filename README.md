# practice
Here are just things I'd like to try, this repository will be updated from time to time.

On the main screen of the app you can see the list of examples I wanted to try. Main screen was written on MVVM.

1) Screen for just drawing
2) Screen with synchronous drawing. You can draw on the top view and the bottom view will reflect that you drew
